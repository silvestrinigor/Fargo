# Area

An area is a two-dimensional space defined by its boundaries. It is commonly used in geometry, physics, and various fields of science and engineering to quantify the extent of a surface or shape. The area is typically measured in square units, such as square meters (m²), square centimeters (cm²), or square feet (ft²).
